        Hello! Iâ€™m Marvens Mertune, a software developer. In May 2022, I
        graduated with a bachelor of science in Computer Engineering. Throughout
        my journey in college, I learned about hardware and software principles
        of computing. These included designing solutions for embedded systems
        and using electrical engineering and computer science skills to build
        solutions to real-world problems. Of the things I learned, developing
        software systems using various programming languages, such as Java and
        C, piqued my interest the most. I translated the skills I learned into
        software development, focusing mainly on web technologies.

        Since graduation, I have been working on projects to improve my skills
        in Software development, learning more about technologies used in the
        industry. Listed below are some of the technologies I have been using:
